Assignment

The task is to write an Ansible playbook doing the following:

- Installs and configures nginx on the host

- Installs and configures php-fpm on the host

- Installs and configures phpmyadmin on the host

- Installs and configures mysql server on the host

We would like to see the following:

1. We take your playbook, configure a host in the inventory file (it will be Ubuntu 18.04 machine) along with preferred mysql root password.

2. We run the playbook on that host.

3. It installs the above software, creates root password from the Ansible host variables.

4. We navigate to http://<virtual machine IP>/phpmyadmin and are able to login using root user and password from the host variables.

Bonus points:

· Code quality and readability

· Documentation (comments)

· Phpmyadmin url configured by host variables (instead of standard /phpmyadmin)

· Ability to deploy and configure mysql backup script from ansible: which databases to backup, destination folder for backups etc.

· Use no external playbooks
